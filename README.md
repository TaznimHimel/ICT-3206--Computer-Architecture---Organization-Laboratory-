## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the code folder:**
    All source files are located in the `CA_Micro_Code_Soft_Files` directory.

3.  **Run an experiment:**
    To run a Python script, for example Lab 01, use the following command:
    ```bash
    python CA_Micro_Code_Soft_Files/labs/01_register_transfer.py
    ```
