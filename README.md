# ICT-3206: Computer Architecture & Microprocessor Lab

This repository contains the complete sessional lab work for the course **ICT-3206: Computer Architecture & Microprocessor** at the Islamic University, Bangladesh. The experiments are designed to build a fundamental understanding of core computer architecture concepts, from basic register operations to pipelining and cache simulation.

[cite_start]The labs are implemented based on the provided manual, with code available in Python, and templates for C++ and MATLAB[cite: 3].

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the code folder:**
    [cite_start]All source files are located in the `CA_Micro_Code_Soft_Files` directory[cite: 4].

3.  **Run an experiment:**
    To run a Python script, for example Lab 01, use the following command:
    ```bash
    python CA_Micro_Code_Soft_Files/labs/01_register_transfer.py
    ```
